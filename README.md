# TestPlanApp
An app to help write and execute bullet-formatted test plans 
The very basic functionality is done!  However, there are some borderline-essential UI things that need to be done.  

## COMING SOON: 
**Quick-Save Test Plan**: Will allow you to close your browser and come back to your test plan later unscathed (can still only have one test plan at a time ://)

## COMING EVENTUALLY...
**Save Test Plan**: Test Plan will be saved to a database so that a user can work on several test plans without losing progress!  
**Login Functionality**: Attaches test plans saved to the db to individual users, and allows users to quickly access their own test plans (and deny access to anyone else)
